<h1>Jennifer's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Movies I like to rewatch.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</h3>
<p>The story and artwork in this anime are stunning. I also appreciate the overall message of the movie; concern for the environment.</p>
<h3>Sucker Punch</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed this film. The story, the reality of the main character's situation, was very sad; however the fantasy sequences were empowering.</p>
<h3>Nation Lampoons Christmas Vacation</h3>
<p>I watch this every holiday season. It makes me laugh intensly. My family and I are always quoting the best lines from the movie.</p>
